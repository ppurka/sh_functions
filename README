This repository contains some files which are to be sourced by bash. The
files contained are:

 1. my_dash_functions: This file used to contain some functions which were
    used in some dash (POSIX) scripts I had. Currently, it simply contains
    some functions that are not used in most of my scripts. It is sourced
    by my_bash_functions.

 2. my_bash_functions: This file contains some bash functions which are
    almost always used in my bash scripts. The important functions are:
    
    centered_output: This outputs some text centered on the terminal. If
    the text is greater than the terminal width, then it simply prints the
    text.
    
    run_loop: This outputs the text with a counter. The counter can go
    either up or down. The text should ideally be short enough to fit
    within the terminal width.

    show_progress: This function outputs a nice progress bar to the
    terminal. It accepts two lines at each increment of the progress bar.
    The first line should be any status message, and the second line
    a ratio given in the form count/total.

 3. my_read_files: This file provides several different interactive bash
    prompts which acts like a file browser or directory browser. There are
    three different such prompts possible.
